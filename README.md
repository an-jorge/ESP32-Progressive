# Progressive guide ESP32

We'll put together a progressive study guide to help you start from scratch with the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and then move on to the ESP-IDF. The idea is that each step will have a clear objective, essential content, practical exercises, and a final project before advancing to the next phase.

The idea is clear: to delve into embedded systems and IoT applications, starting with the ESP32 board.
